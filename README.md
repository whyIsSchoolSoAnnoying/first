P2 site code, people wanted this to be released for a while so I'm doing it.

# Local Alloy Proxy

This site contains a local Alloy Proxy server.

If you are not using Heroku, here's the gist of how you get this going:

cd to the directory where you are hosting this, with apache2, the default is "/var/www/html".

Make sure NPM has adequate access.

run "npm install" and wait for it to finish.

run "screen npm start" and the site is live.

visit http://DOMAIN.COM:8080/ to view your site (NPM runs on 8080 by default, you can fix this with iptables if you wish)
